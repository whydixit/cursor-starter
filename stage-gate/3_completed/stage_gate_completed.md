Context: A feature folder has been moved into the completed stage. 
The folder is referenced in this chat.

Instructions:

Review the Feature: Read and synthesise the content within the referenced 
folder — including README.md, spec.md, design.md, and any 
implementation_notes.md — to gain a clear understanding of what was delivered,
how it works, and what outcomes it achieves.

Generate Completion Summary: Write a concise 1–3 paragraph summary describing:

- The purpose of the feature
- What was built
- Any notable design decisions or functional results

Create summary.md: Save the summary into the same folder as a new file titled 
summary.md.

Log the Completion: Create a single-line log entry for inclusion in the 
organisation-wide completed_features_log.md:

Format:
- **[Feature Name]:** Completed [YYYY-MM-DD]. 
[One-sentence summary of purpose/outcome].

Suggest Architecture Review: Identify which specific sections of 
docs/_reference/architecture.md might need a human review based on 
this feature. Do not edit the architecture file directly — 
simply suggest targeted areas for consideration 
(e.g., “Consider updating the 'API Endpoints' section due to new endpoint X”).

Output:

- Provide the content of the generated summary.md.
- Provide the exact log entry to append to 
  docs/_reference/completed_features_log.md.
- Provide the list of suggested sections in architecture.md that may 
  need review.

Note
Once you’ve completed this, continue by assisting with any architectural 
review, documentation updates, or rollout tasks. This process may involve multiple steps and tool calls.
