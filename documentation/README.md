# Documentation Phase Prompts

This folder contains prompts for creating comprehensive documentation for your projects. These prompts help you document your code, APIs, and project structure to make your codebase more maintainable and accessible.

## Available Prompts

### Project Documentation
- **[README Generator](./readme-generator.md)** - Create comprehensive, professional README files
- **[Repository Snapshot](./repository-snapshot.md)** - Generate high-level project overview and identify documentation gaps

## When to Use Documentation Prompts

### Project Documentation
- **README Generator** when you need to create or improve your project's main documentation
- **Repository Snapshot** when you want to understand and document your entire project structure

### For New Projects
- Use **README Generator** to create professional project documentation from scratch
- Use **Repository Snapshot** to audit your project and identify missing documentation

### For Existing Projects
- Use **Repository Snapshot** to get a comprehensive overview and find documentation gaps
- Use **README Generator** to improve existing documentation

## Documentation Workflow

A systematic approach to documenting your project:

1. **Project Analysis** → Use Repository Snapshot to understand your project structure
2. **Documentation Planning** → Identify what documentation is needed
3. **README Creation** → Use README Generator for main project documentation
4. **Ongoing Documentation** → Regular snapshots to keep documentation current

## Pro Tips for Documentation

### Repository Snapshot
- Run this regularly as your project evolves
- Great for onboarding new team members
- Use suggestions to prioritise documentation improvements
- Perfect for project audits and health checks

### README Generator
- Include concrete examples from your actual project
- Focus on the user journey - installation to usage
- Keep it updated as features change
- Make it scannable with good formatting

## Integration with Other Phases

- **From Planning**: Use PRD and architecture documents as input for documentation
- **From Development**: Document code created with [Development Phase](../development/) prompts
- **From Testing**: Include testing documentation and coverage reports
- **To Maintenance**: Documentation helps with ongoing project maintenance

## Documentation Strategy Quick Reference

| I want to... | Use this prompt |
|--------------|----------------|
| Understand my entire project structure | Repository Snapshot |
| Create a professional README | README Generator |
| Find documentation gaps | Repository Snapshot |
| Improve existing documentation | README Generator |

## Documentation Best Practices

### Repository Snapshot Usage
- **Run with full access** - make sure Cursor can see your entire repository
- **Act on suggestions** - use the recommendations to improve your project
- **Regular audits** - run periodically to catch documentation drift
- **Share with team** - great for project health discussions

### README Quality
- **Start with user needs** - what do they need to know first?
- **Include practical examples** - working code snippets
- **Maintain accuracy** - keep documentation in sync with code
- **Consider your audience** - technical vs non-technical users

## Next Steps

After creating documentation:
- Use [Deployment Phase](../deployment/) prompts to include deployment documentation
- Use [Maintenance Phase](../maintenance/) prompts to keep documentation current
- Consider using the documentation as input for other planning and development prompts
